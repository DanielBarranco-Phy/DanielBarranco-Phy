I'm final-year physics student in the UK with a passion for data in general, currently developing my skills into machine learning and coding. I´m also passionate about solving real-world problems, getting meaninful insights and optimizing processes through data. 📈

I’m currently working on my dissertation: 
Automatic Classification of Pulsars using ML on Time Series Data. 💻

With hands-on experience in semiconductor research and a growing skill set in Python, I’m transitioning into data science with a strong foundation in analytics, curiosity, and a learner’s mindset. Always open to new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities to grow. 😁
