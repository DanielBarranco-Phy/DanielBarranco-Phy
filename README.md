## Hi! I'm Daniel Barranco 🚀


I'm a final-year physics student in the UK with a passion for data, currently developing my skills into machine learning and coding. I'm also passionate about solving real-world problems, getting meaningful insights and optimizing processes through data. 📈


I’m currently working on my dissertation: 

Automatic Classification of Pulsars using ML on Time Series Data 💻


With hands-on experience in semiconductor research and a growing skill set in Python, I’m transitioning into data science with a strong foundation in analytics, curiosity, and a learner’s mindset. Always open to new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities to grow. 😁
